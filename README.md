### What is Aatiy?
Aatiy is a fintech application that is been develop to clear the problem faced
by so many africans and other people when trying to purchase things online. During December of last year, one of the founders of this project faced a problem while trying to activate his card to purchase a service online. The local bank wasn't able to resolve his issue, and we figured that this is not only a problem faced by 1 person, and that it may have been caused by restricted rules or behaviors by certain local banks. In order to give the opportunity to all people out there to open an account and be able to purchase what they want, we will work on our own virtual bank, that can give you the freedom to build your own card kingdom, an give you access to any service you may want to join in the world without much restrictions or additional fees! :).
